There are extra revision slides linked somewhere.

Important bits about BGP:
- Attributes
  - Next Hop
  - AS Path
  - Origin
  - Local Preference (choice of exit node)
  - Extended Communities
  - Multi-exit discriminator
- When you get attributes, how do you pick best route?

External BGP protocols are different from internal as there's competition between ISPs

BGP can't have loops because the path is included in the AS Path attribute.

BGP routing decision process, in order:
- Higher weight
- Highest local preference
- Shortest AS path
- Lowest origin
- Lowest med
- EGP to IGP (hot potato)
- Shortest internal path
- Prefer oldest route
- Lowest router id
- Lowest IP interface address
